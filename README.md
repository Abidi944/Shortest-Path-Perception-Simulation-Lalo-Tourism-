=> DesyahranieTourism <=

It is a program that provides efficient travel simulations in terms of routes for users (tourists) when they want to go on holiday to tourist destinations on Lombok Island. The introduction of tourist destinations and improving the tourist experience with efficient travel time is the background for creating the program. Choosing an efficient route is seen from the shortest distance from the area of â€‹â€‹origin to the destination area or the area where the tourist destination you want to go to is located. In this case, the program uses the Short Path Perception (SPP) algorithm which is generally known as the Djikstra algorithm. The program provides data on tourist destinations in 4 districts and 1 municipality, including East Lombok Regency, West Lombok Regency, Central Lombok Regency, North Lombok Regency and Mataram City. Each district and city is represented by sub-districts within its territory as locations for certain tourist destinations. Tourist destinations in the form of natural tourism which are already or not yet known to many people, consist of natural and artificial tourism.
